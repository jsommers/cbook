    <h4>Preface</h4>

Get ready to learn one of the most influential programming languages ever developed!  If you know some Java, you'll find C's syntax familiar (Java's syntax is based on C) and many of the same control structures.  That familiarity can be deceptive, though.  C is totally unforgiving and will allow you (nay, give you the weapon) to shoot yourself in the foot [#f1]_.  On the other hand, you'll develop a much better understanding of computer systems as your knowledge of C grows.  Have fun, and good luck!

This book is loosely based on the "Essential C" document written by Nick Parlante at Stanford University.  The original document is available at http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/101/.  The Essential C document was last updated in 2003, which is one reason why this document exists.  Programming languages and compilers change, and I wanted to take the good work that Nick had done and make several updates to modernize and tailor the text.  The notice reproduced below is copied from Essential C:
