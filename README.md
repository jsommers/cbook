# The Book of C

This is an introductory text for the C programming language, currently
used in the operating systems course at Colgate University (COSC 301).
This text is based on the earlier work *Essential C* written by Nick Parlante at Stanford University.  The original document is available at http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/101/.  The Essential C document was last updated in 2003, which is the main reason this text was created.  C has undergone some interesting and useful changes over the past few years and I wanted to take the good work that Nick had done and make several updates to modernize the text.  The notice reproduced below is copied from Essential C:  

> **Stanford CS Education Library**. This is document #101, Essential C, in the Stanford CS Education Library. This and other educational materials are available for free at http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/. This article is free to be used, reproduced, excerpted, retransmitted, or sold so long as this notice is clearly reproduced at its beginning.

## Suggestions or edits

Please file bug reports or create pull requests for any bugs or typos found, or suggestions for improvement.  Note that the intention is to keep this text small and concise, so its scope is, by design, quite narrow (and I don't intend to change that).
